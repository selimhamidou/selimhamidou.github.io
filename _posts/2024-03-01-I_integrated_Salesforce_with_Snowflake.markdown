Ok. I could begin this post with the famous "Who has currently heard about Salesforce Data Cloud?". But, let's be honest. Everybody has, at least once in their life, heard about Salesforce Data Cloud. Basically, it's like knowing Zidane, Kylian Mbappe or Adriano. And, as its name let us know, this cloud allow us to manipulate data. Ok, but whata more than that? Because Salesforce Sales Cloud has data too! In fact, the role of Salesforce Data Cloud is to respond to a specific(but still hugely important) need. We've got more and more data(especially from Marketing Cloud and the other clouds, like Sales Cloud, or even other platforms, like we are going to see on this post), and we don't know how to treat them. We want to know that this guy has just bought an iphone, that a guy with the same data has also bought a computer few years ago. Oh, now Salesforce Data Cloud just discovered that it's this same guy. Let's use the insights, and see that could be interested in buying an Apple laptop. It's a simple exemple, but it's illustrating what we can do with Salesforce Data Cloud. As I said, Data can come from Salesforce products(Marketing cloud especially), but also from non Salesforce products(Amazon S3, but also Snowflake). Snowflake is what we call a Data Lake. A data lake is simply a big thing where we store huge volumes of data. I like this image of a lake, I imagine all these data flotting somewhere in a sea(we are talking about infinite data volumes. A swimming pool wouldn't be sufficient for this.). Knowing that Salesforce Data Cloud is very powerful to treat data, sometimes we need to access them from Snowflake. But how?

### Salesforce Sales Cloud to Data Cloud : A quick win
We all love quick win. It's simple to implement, but still making our day. We have a specific need. A client has its data on Sales cloud, and he would like to get these data on Salesforce data cloud. How can we do this?

First step, we create our Snowflake login. 
So we go to this link, and
